# AI vs Real Image Detector (GUI with Keras)

This is a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras that detects whether an image is AI-generated (fake) or a real photo. The model is trained on 120,000+ images and provides predictions through a simple GUI made with Tkinter.

## Features
- Detects AI vs real images from local files
- Easy-to-use graphical interface
- Trained on CIFAKE dataset (CIFAR-10 real images vs AI-generated images)

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 (recommended)
- TensorFlow 2.10
- Pillow
